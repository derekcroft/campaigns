<p>The only personal information we collect is information that you provide. "Personal information," as used in this
  Policy, means information that is directly associated with a particular person, such as name, address, telephone
  number and email address. We may request personal information in order to provide various types of services or
  information to you. For example, personal information may be requested in connection with your affirmative request to
  receive email or other communications from us, or a contribution made to an organization using Kiindly's service for a
  fundraiser.</p>

<p>Our general policy is to not make personal information provided online available to anyone other than our employees,
  staff and agents, except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy.</p>

<p>Third parties providing services to us may have limited access to your personal information. Access to your personal
  information by these service providers is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for them to perform
  their limited function for us. We require these service providers to protect the privacy of your personal information
  in a manner consistent with this Policy, and to not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other
  than providing the service to us.</p>

<p>We may release personal information to third parties to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law,
  regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order. The security of your personal information is important to us. We
  maintain a variety of physical, electronic and administrative safeguards to protect personal information you provide
  to us. For example, we have adopted commercially reasonable tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized
  access to our systems. We use a secured/encrypted server for online credit card contributions.</p>
