<h4><a name="cat1-q1"></a>How does the Penny Pledge work?</h4>
<p>The penny pledge is a social match of one penny per donor. When you make a penny pledge for a specific campaign, you
  select the penny pledge and you also select a maximum donation amount. Your final donation amount will be determined
  as follows: the total number of unique donors at the end of the campaign multiplied by one penny for each donor. For
  example, if there are 5,000 donors at the end of a campaign, your donation amount will be 5,000 pennies ($50.00). If
  the total number of donors exceeds your maximum pledge amount, your final donation will be the maximum pledge amount.
  For example, if you selected a $10 maximum and 5,000 people donate, your donation will remain at the $10 limit you
  selected.</p>

<h4><a name="cat1-q2"></a>What is a fixed donation?</h4>
<p>A fixed donation is just that, a specific fixed amount that a donor wishes to give. The amount a donor is charged for
  a fixed donation is the exact amount of the fixed donation. This donation option is for donors who wish to donate a
  specific amount. Donors who make fixed donations are still part of the social match and counted in the total number of
  donors used to calculate the final penny pledge donation amounts.</p>

<h4><a name="cat1-q3"></a>Is my donation tax deductible?</h4>
<p>You should consult with your tax advisor on all contributions you make. Many organizations who use the Kiindly
  service are non profit organizations. We will provide you with a receipt for each donation you make that you may use
  for your tax records should the donation qualify as tax deductible.</p>

<h4><a name="cat1-q4"></a>Am I charged 1 penny at a time?</h4>
<p>No, we process all donations at the end of the campaign. When you first enter your credit card, we do validate the
  card but we don't process your final contribution until the end of the campaign.</p>

<h4><a name="cat1-q5"></a>When do I get charged?</h4>
<p>Within 7 days after the end of the campaign, we will process your credit card and send you a receipt. Once you
  complete your pledge or fixed donation you will receive a confirmation email which contains the end date of the
  campaign.</p>

<h4><a name="cat1-q6"></a>Is my donation matched?</h4>
<p>The virtue of the Kiindly Penny Pledge is the social match. Anyone who takes the penny pledge is agreeing to pay one
  penny multiplied by the total number of donors in the campaign, including donors who make fixed pledges. As a result,
  when you make a fixed or penny pledge, dozens, hundreds, or thousands of other donors increase their pledge by
  $.01.<br/>
  In addition, an individual campaign may have a corporate match in effect. If this is the case, it will be indicated in
  the 'About this campaign' text on the campaign landing page.</p>

<h4><a name="cat1-q7"></a>Can I make multiple donations to increase the amount per donor?</h4>
<p>No. While this is a creative idea, it does not match the spirit of the social match provided by Kiindly. As a result,
  we only count donors as unique donors which means if you make multiple donations, you will be charged for all of your
  donations, but you will only be counted once in calculating the number of donors for the penny pledge calculation.</p>

<h4><a name="cat3-q1"></a>How much of my donation goes to this campaign?</h4>
<p>The organization running the campaign will receive the sum of all donations minus the actual credit card fee charged
  by the credit card provider and minus the transaction fee charged by Kiindly. Since all donations taken via a credit
  card include a credit card fee, the only incremental charge for the organization is the Kiindly transaction fee. The
  final amount the organization receives is the sum of all donations net of the credit card fees minus $1.20 multiplied
  by the number of donors (Kiindly's transaction fee).</p>

<h4><a name="cat3-q2"></a>Why is there a transaction fee?</h4>
<p>Fundraising often requires organizations to spend significant amounts of money with third party experts,
  telemarketers, and direct mail in order to accomplish fundraising goals. A typical fundraising campaign not run
  through Kiindly will often cost 15-20% of the total amount raised, meaning only 80-85% of your donation will go to the
  organization and the organization must often take the risk of the marketing investment regardless of the success of
  the campaign. Through Kiindly, organizations take on zero risk in the marketing investment (there are no upfront
  costs) and the final cost is often significantly less than the cost of traditional means of fundraising. Our goal at
  Kiindly is to cover our costs and make a fair profit so that we can help many more organizations. We charge a
  transaction fee that we believe is fair and on par with transaction fees charged for other types of online purchases
  such as movies and events.</p>

<h4><a name="cat4-q1"></a>What is Kiindly?</h4>
<p>Kiindly is a company which powers social fundraising for organizations ranging from charities to universities to
  local groups, all based on Kiindly's proprietary social matching process (aka our secret sauce). Because every penny
  counts, we help donors participate with organizations and be empowered at the same time. </p>

<h4><a name="cat4-q2"></a>How can I start a Kiindly campaign?</h4>
<p>If you are a charity, non-profit, university, political organization, religious group, local organization, or any
  other organization looking to fundraise, Kiindly was set up to help you. Please contact us here in order to set up
  your own campaign.</p>

<h4><a name="cat4-q3"></a>Why should an organization use Kiindly?</h4>
<p>If you want to raise money by empowering your donors versus guilting them, a Kiindly fundraiser is for you.I If you
  want to raise money leveraging the power of social media and the insights of behavioral science, then a Kiindly
  fundraiser is for you. We believe that the essence of fundraising is about the donor and the donor relationship.
  Through years of work in behavioral science and online technology, Kiindly discovered that donors want exactly what
  fundraising organizations want: for every penny to count. As a result, the Kiindly Penny Pledge and our other social
  matching products, which are proprietary to Kiindly, work better and quicker than other fundraisers because every
  penny does count.</p>

<h4><a name="cat4-q4"></a>Are there any start up costs for a Kiindly campaign?</h4>
<p>There are no start up costs for a typical Kiindly campaign. Kiindly does offer custom consulting services for
  organizations that desire greater assistance. Kiindly will provide custom consulting to help such organizations to
  develop the specific creative and messaging for an organization's campaign. These services are provided on a fee
  basis.</p>
