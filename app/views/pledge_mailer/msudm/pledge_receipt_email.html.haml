    %p Dear #{@donor.first_name},

    %p
      Remember when you did something you were proud of in grade school and your parents would hang it on the refrigerator?

    %p
      Your pledge of 
      = number_to_currency(@pledge.amount, precision: 2)
      per donor has impacted an entire community by increasing
      = @campaign.pledges.count - 1
      pledges from other supporters, which adds up quickly. Be proud that you have helped
      a good cause. We are grateful for your gift and the trust imparted to us in managing its use.

    %p
      You can help
      -#= @pledge.dancer.name
      this dancer
      even more by spreading the word about this campaign by sharing on Facebook,
      pinning to Pinterest, or just printing this email and finding new space on the refrigerator.

    %p
      Regards,
